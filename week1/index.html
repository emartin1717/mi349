          My name's Eric Martin to start things off. My main interest within media is 3D animation, particularly within games. As you've probably already guessed, I don't remember much from the class
          before this outside of some basic css and html. BUT! I look forward to relearning and advancing my abilites! I will be one of the many students working on building a portfolio website.
